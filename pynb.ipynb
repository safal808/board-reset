    "The patient is at high risk for undiagnosed or progressing liver injury due to a critical and sustained absence of liver function test (LFT) monitoring after February 2025, precisely when exposed to multiple highly hepatotoxic agents. Key exposures include Methotrexate (15mg weekly, re-introduced despite prior GI intolerance and inconsistent Folic Acid intake) and turmeric supplements (reported in October 2024), both known causes of Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). The patient's debilitating fatigue has been worsening and intensifying from late 2024 into 2026, temporally aligning with these exposures and the lack of monitoring, suggesting potential undetected liver dysfunction. Furthermore, significant metabolic risk factors such as Class I obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and newly diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus predispose the patient to Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)/Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), which increases susceptibility to DILI. The absence of viral serologies and autoimmune markers leaves alternative liver conditions unexcluded.\n",

Long-term methotrexate therapy is associated with fatty infiltration and fibrosis, with a potential to progress to cirrhosis [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Drug-associated Fatty Liver Disease (DAFLD), p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. Therefore, patients with pre-existing liver fibrosis or cirrhosis would be at a significantly increased risk of accelerated liver disease progression.\\n\\n            Furthermore, components of metabolic syndrome, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, are considered risk factors for the occurrence and severity of methotrexate-associated fatty liver disease [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Underlying Diseases and Comorbidity, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. A study highlighted the association between obesity and type 2 diabetes and patients being listed for liver transplantation due to end-stage methotrexate-related liver disease [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Underlying Diseases and Comorbidity, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. This indicates that patients with these metabolic conditions are at a higher risk of developing severe hepatotoxicity.\\n\\n            Finally, regular alcohol intake is recognized as a contributing factor for DILI associated with methotrexate [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Alcohol and Pregnancy, p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf]. Patients with a history of regular alcohol consumption would face an elevated risk of methotrexate-induced liver injury. The guidelines recommend intense monitoring regimens, including liver biopsies, to detect clinically significant and reversible hepatic fibrosis, and emphasize weighing the benefits of treatment against the risk of progressive liver disease [cite: EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Drug-associated Fatty Liver Disease (DAFLD), p.1, https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf].\\n        </detailed_answer>\\n        <guideline_references>\\n            {\\n                \"Source\": \"EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Drug-associated Fatty Liver Disease (DAFLD)\",\\n                \"Link\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf\",\\n                \"Supporting\": \"Reports that long-term methotrexate therapy is associated with fatty infiltration and fibrosis, with a potential to progress to cirrhosis...

Someone is asking me about contraindications for methotrexate, specifically within the context of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) as outlined in these guidelines. My brain immediately goes into expert mode.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to hunt down every mention of \"methotrexate\" within the provided text chunks. It\\\\\\'s a key word, so the search shouldn\\\\\\'t be too hard. Once I\\\\\\'ve located it, my focus sharpens. I\\\\\\'ll be scrutinizing the text surrounding each mention of methotrexate, laser-focused on identifying any factors that might make its use a bad idea, or at the very least, a risky one. Because these guidelines emphasize liver injury, I\\\\\\'ll pay extra attention to anything related to liver health.\\\\n\\\\nMy methodology, which I’ve refined over countless literature reviews, will include:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Keyword Search and Location:** First, the obvious. Find the keyword “methotrexate” across all relevant guideline chunks. That’s my starting point.\\\\n2.  **Risk Factor Extraction:** Next, I\\\\\\'ll meticulously extract any associated risks or contraindications.

       "    \"=== CHUNK 1 ===\\nContent: # Segment : Drug-associated Fatty Liver Disease (DAFLD)\\n\\nNAFLD is an entity associated with accumulation of fat in >5% of hepatocytes with or without inflammation and fibrosis in those who do not consume alcohol over the amount considered moderate (21 units in men and 14 units in women per week). Although initially described as a histological entity, in clinical practice, excess fat is detected through any of the imaging modalities and accepted as evidence of hepatic steatosis. When the condition is associated with characteristic features of metabolic syndrome or no risk factors are obvious it is considered primary NAFLD, while drugs are behind a proportion of ‘secondary’ NAFLD cases. A high prevalence of obesity and NAFLD in the general population means that the strength of association between individual drugs and fatty liver is variably dependent upon the particular drug. Risk factors associated with DAFLD are described in a separate section above.\\n\\n### DAFLD: Amiodarone\\n\\nHepatic storage of amiodarone may cause phospholipidosis with a characteristic histopathological appearance of intracellular lamellar inclusion bodies.201 Amiodarone and its metabolite are concentrated in the hepatic mitochondria, inhibit electron transport and uncouple oxidative phosphorylation.202 A amiodarone-related hepatic adverse reaction appears to be related to the total dose; hepatotoxicity can manifest either acutely or chronically. Raised liver enzymes appear within hours and days following initiation of intravenous administration and the enzymes normalise on cessation of the drug. In the context of cardiogenic shock amiodarone-induced liver injury can be difficult to distinguish from ischaemic injury. On oral administration, liver disease manifests after 3 months in the majority and takes weeks to months to reverse on withdrawal. Symptomatic hepatic dysfunction may occur in 1–3% of patients using amiodarone.203 All of the histological hallmarks of NASH, including ballooning, Mallory-Denk bodies, fibrosis and cirrhosis have been described.204\\n\\n### DAFLD: Methotrexate\\n\\nReports that long-term methotrexate therapy is associated with fatty infiltration and fibrosis, with a potential to progress to cirrhosis, have resulted in a plethora of publications describing cohorts of patients receiving methotrexate for psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory disease. The proportion of patients estimated to have any degree of liver fibrosis varies from 6% to 72%; those with advanced fibrosis range from 0% to 33% and cirrhosis from 0% to 26%.205 Such a wide range of reported pathology is due largely to heterogeneity of cohorts, study designs, methods of evaluating histological changes and the case mix. A recent study highlighted the rarity of decompensated cirrhosis associated with methotrexate therapy; of over 150,000 adults who had been listed for or received liver transplantation during a period of 24 years, only 117 had methotrexate-associated cirrhosis.104 Methotrexate polyglutamate within the cell interferes with pyrimidine and purine synthesis, through which it exerts its therapeutic effect. In addition, methotrexate indirectly affects methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and hence the generation of methionine from homocysteine. Excess homocysteine induces ER stress, which, when unresolved, leads to fatty infiltration of the liver. Homocysteine, in addition, can also activate pro-inflammatory cytokines and activate hepatic stellate cells, leading to liver fibrosis.206 Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene polymorphisms (C677T in particular) have been associated with hepatotoxicity due to methotrexate. A metaanalysis demonstrated an OR of 4.19 (95% CI 1.6–10.7) for the TT vs. CC genotype.207 Assessment of the risk-benefit ratio of long-term methotrexate therapy depends upon the efficacy of the drug in an individual weighed against the rate of progression of hepatic fibrosis. Reports that long-term methotrexate therapy is associated with a potential to develop fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis, have resulted in numerous guidelines recommending intense monitoring regimens including liver biopsies at regular intervals. The primary objective of monitoring is to detect hepatic fibrosis that is of clinical significance, yet reversible on withdrawal of the drug. Recently, a number of algorithms, serum biomarkers and imaging techniques have been introduced into clinical practice to non-invasively evaluate the severity of chronic liver diseases.208 Some of these methods are being evaluated as tools to monitor patients on methotrexate treatment.103,209–211 Large-scale well-designed studies to validate these tools in clinical practice are underway.\\n\\n### DAFLD: Tamoxifen and Chemotherapy\\n\\nTamoxifen: Treatment with tamoxifen, an oestrogenreceptor antagonist, has been associated with fat accumulation within the liver. The association between tamoxifen and DAFLD is demonstrated in a large clinical trial; incidence of fatty liver disease was 2-fold higher (hazard ratio = 2.0; 95% CI 1.1–3.5) in those exposed to the drug.99 None in this large trial developed cirrhosis over a median follow-up of 8.7 years although another registry of tamoxifen treated patients reported the presence of NASH in 2.2% of patients (defined by a combination of liver enzyme elevation, imaging features and biopsy in some case), as well as 2 patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis.100 Tamoxifen-induced fatty liver disease occurred only in overweight or obese women with metabolic syndrome83 which indicates that host risk factors influence the susceptibility to DAFLD. Interestingly, a recent report associated PNPLA3 and/or TM6SF2 variant alleles with hepatic steatosis and elevated ALT levels in those exposed to glucagon receptor antagonists.212 Chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis: Reactive oxygen species generated by chemotherapy intended to induce tumour cell apoptosis can also lead to the development of steatohepatitis especially in those with pre-existent hepatic steatosis; obesity is associated with an increased risk. Drugs commonly associated with steatohepatitis include 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan. Chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis increases the risk of infections, liver failure and overall mortality following major liver resections (for hepatic metastasis).\\n\\n### Recommendation for DAFLD\\n\\nParticular drugs, such as amiodarone, methotrexate, tamoxifen and the chemotherapeutic agents 5- fluorouracil and irinotecan, should be considered as risk factors for fatty liver disease and decisions to continue or withdraw the medication rely upon the benefits of the treatment against the risk of progressive liver disease.

       "    \"=== CHUNK 2 ===\\nContent: # Segment : Alcohol and Pregnancy\\n\\nSimilar to age, alcohol consumption is included as a risk factor in the CIOMS/RUCAM causality assessment scale and gives an extra point to patients with a known history of alcohol consumption, although no specific level of consumption has been defined.63 Alcohol is a recognised CYP2E1 inducer and as such of crucial importance in the formation of N-acetyl-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the reactive metabolite responsible for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. However, data to support alcohol as a risk factor for idiosyncratic DILI are only available for selected drugs, such as isoniazid, methotrexate and halothane.86 Curiously, any alcohol use in the preceding 12 months was a negative predictor of severe DILI (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.15–0.76) in the DILIN cohort.48 Nevertheless, the recovery of idiosyncratic DILI induced by any causative agent in patients with an underlying alcohol-induced liver condition may be hampered by the latter condition. A more recent study of the effect of alcohol on DILI by the DILIN group found that heavy alcohol consumption (men: >3 drinks/day, women: >2 drinks/day) was not associated with worse outcomes in DILI patients compared to no alcohol consumption. Anabolic steroids were found to be the most common cause of DILI among the heavy drinkers. However, this could be a behavioural association rather than a pathophysiological link as stated by the authors. Furthermore, this study found no evidence for alcohol consumption being a risk factor for DILI attributed to isoniazid.87 Limited evidence is available to support that pregnant women are more susceptible to DILI, despite the inclusion of pregnancy as a risk factor for cholestatic/mixed type of DILI in the CIOMS/RUCAM causality assessment scale.63 Furthermore, it is important to distinguish DILI during pregnancy from intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, which can have a similar clinical picture. Information on drugs associated with DILI in pregnant women is mainly restricted to antihypertensive agents (such as methyldopa and hydralazine), antihyperthyroidism agents (propylthiouracil) and antimicrobials (in particular tetracycline and antiretroviral agents). The link between pregnancy and DILI due to methyldopa and hydralazine likely stems from the fact that these drugs are used to treat gestational hypertension. A small number of resultant DILI cases have been reported, however the majority of DILI case reports concerning these antihypertensive agents involve non-pregnant patients, in particular for methyldopa.88–90 The hepatotoxic potential of propylthiouracil has been recognised in the form of a black box warning issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 and soon thereafter by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).91 While paediatric patients appear to be at higher risk of propylthiouracil hepatotoxicity, little evidence supports that pregnancy would be a risk factor for this type of DILI.92 Nevertheless, propylthiouracil DILI resulting in liver transplantation during pregnancy has been reported.93 Similar to methyldopa and hydralazine, propylthiouracil is most likely associated with DILI during pregnancy because it is advocated as the treatment of choice for pregnant women with hyperthyroidism during the first trimester. Tetracycline is currently the only known drug for which pregnancy appears to increase the risk of DILI development. Tetracycline is known to cause ‘‘microvesicular steatosis of the liver” also referred to as ‘‘acute fatty liver of pregnancy”, in particular after taking large doses intravenously;94,95 this has led to removal of intravenous preparations from clinical practice. Hence, tetracycline-associated fatty liver of pregnancy appears to be more dose-dependent than the more typical examples of idiosyncratic DILI. Hepatotoxicity due to tetracycline, however, is not limited to pregnant women, but has likewise been reported for men.96 Tetracycline depresses cell anabolism by interfering with protein synthesis, inhibiting acetate metabolism and impairing oxidative phosphorylation. It is believed that the increased demands for protein anabolism in the liver during pregnancy, make pregnant women more susceptible to tetracycline-induced hepatotoxicity. In terms of antiinfectives, several studies have been reported in the area of antiretroviral hepatotoxicity in pregnant women.97,98 However, the role of pregnancy as an independent risk factor for this form of DILI is debatable.\\n\\n### Statement on Alcohol Intake\\n\\nRegular alcohol intake may be a contributing factor for DILI associated with specific drugs such as isoniazid, methotrexate and halothane.

       "    \"=== CHUNK 3 ===\\nContent: # Segment : Chronic Liver Disease\\n\\nAn assumption that chronic liver disease may be associated with reduced metabolism and clearance of medications is not supported by strong evidence. Studies in alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have found inconsistent results with induction, downregulation or no alteration in the activities of different DMEs.105,106 Some of these variations may be explained by the varying degree of liver injury of individuals studied and others due to the methodologies used, yet, no generalisations can be made with regards to the impact of liver function on drug disposition in chronic liver disease. Clinical trials involving treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection report a high rate of hepatic adverse reactions ranging from 2% to 18%107 with lower incidence of DILI in larger studies. The vast majority of these events (84%) only led to either a temporary or no interruption of therapy.108 The contribution of each particular drug to the development of hepatotoxicity in a ‘highly active antiretroviral therapy’ (HAART) regimen is difficult to determine; a number of mechanisms including mitochondrial toxicity, inflammatory response to viral infection and adaptive immune response have all been hypothesised. In 16 adult acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Clinical Trial Group studies involving 8,851 patients, hepatitis C (HCV) coinfection and baseline elevations of ALT were associated with an increased risk of DILI (defined as >5 ULN for ALT or >2.5 ULN of total bilirubin [TBL]).109 Another review that grouped studies involving antiretroviral therapy and those including non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors demonstrated that pre-existent liver disease including chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HCV infection as well as alcoholic liver disease and elevated liver enzymes prior to initiation of therapy were risk factors for DILI (defined as elevation of 2–3 times above the baseline of ALT or AST).107 Immune reconstitution could be one of the mechanisms that mediates liver injury under this set of circumstances. It has been hypothesised that the immune deficit caused by HIV infection is responsible for the attenuation of the inflammatory reaction in the liver and antiretroviral therapy by inhibiting HIV replication leads to immune reconstitution which could unmask liver toxicity. Anti-TBC therapy where patients are regularly monitored permits investigation of risk factors for DILI. A systematic review of 15 studies demonstrated that when ALT elevation >5 ULN was applied as a threshold, chronic hepatitis B was associated with DILI (OR 3.4) in an analysis restricted to prospective studies.110 A recent retrospective study involving 379 (including 128 patients with chronic viral hepatitis) receiving anti-TBC therapy found that HCV on its own or in combination with HBV was associated with increased incidence of DILI.111 HIV infection has also been shown to increase the risk of anti-TBC DILI by 4-fold and coinfection with HCV increased this risk by 14-fold.112 In a large cohort of DILI, 10% had pre-existing liver disease, mainly chronic hepatitis C or raised liver enzymes; azithromycin was the implicated agent in a higher proportion of patients with pre-existing liver disease (6.7%) compared to those without liver disease (1.5%).16 Mortality was significantly higher in those with chronic liver disease (16%) compared to those without (5.2%). In a cohort of 107 patients with chronic liver disease including 58 with cirrhosis receiving anti-TBC therapy, 17% experienced DILI including 24% with chronic hepatitis and 15% with compensated cirrhosis.113\\n\\n### Statements on Underlying Diseases\\n\\nComponents of metabolic syndrome should be considered risk factors for the occurrence and the degree of DAFLD in patients treated with tamoxifen and methotrexate.\\nEvidence: Level 1b and 2b studies (RCT and individual cohort studies)\\n\\nChronic hepatitis B and C can be considered risk factors for DILI from anti-HIV and anti-TBC therapy.\\nEvidence: Level 2a studies (systematic review of cohort studies)\\nSource: DILI_17_Chronic_Li.md\\nFile ID: DILI_chunks_DILI_17_Chronic_Li.md\\nSegment_ID: DILI_chunks\\nAttributes: {'Segment_ID': 'DILI_chunks', 'segment_id': 'DILI_chunks', 'filename': 'DILI_17_Chronic_Li.md', 'content_length': 4122, 'pdf_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf', 'pdf_name': 'EASL_Clinical_Practice_Guidelines_Drug_induced_liver_injury.pdf', 'title': 'EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Chronic Liver Disease', 'category': 'Liver Disease', 'author': 'EASL', 'page_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf#page=1', 'page_number': 1}\\nScore: 0.3947\\n=================\",\n",
       "    \"=== CHUNK 4 ===\\nContent: # Segment : Nodular Regenerative Hyperplasia and Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome\\n\\nSome drugs can injure endothelial cells of sinusoids and portal venules with consequent occlusion or dropout of smaller radicles. Widespread vascular changes lead to diffuse nodularity within the hepatic parenchyma. The hepatocytes within the nodule are arranged in plates that are more than 1 cell in thickness while hepatocytes are compressed and atrophied into thin, parallel plates between nodules.213 Characteristically, the nodules are not separated by fibrosis although there could be perisinusoidal fibrosis and incomplete fibrous septae. Magnetic resonance imaging may demonstrate a characteristic pattern with a sensitivity and specificity of 75–80%214 although there is no consensus on the use of imaging in the diagnosis. In patients on azathioprine therapy, the cumulative rate of development of nodular regenerative hyperplasia has been estimated to be 0.5% over 5 years and 1.5% over 10 years,215 although nodular regenerative hyperplasia has also been described in the post-liver transplantation setting in the absence of azathioprine therapy.216 Early recognition and withdrawal of the medication has been shown to lead to histological resolution over a 5-year period.217 Otherwise, management is focused on surveillance and prevention of manifestations of portal hypertension. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia as indicated by liver histology has been reported in 8% (8/97) of a HIV-positive cohort receiving HAART.218 In another case series, it was shown that 11 HIV patients with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension had all been exposed to didanosine for prolonged periods.219 Other drugs associated with this form of liver disease are 6-thioguanine, busulphan, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, cytosine arabinoside, carmustine, and doxorubicin. In recent literature, oxaliplatin is the most common drug associated with this pathology.220 In a large group of patients treated with oxaliplatin, nodular regenerative hyperplasia was found on histology in 25% and features consistent with SOS in over 50% of patients.221 SOS has also been related to pyrrolizidine alkaloids as discussed in the Epidemiology chapter on the burden of herbal supplements.\\n\\n### Recommendation for Nodular Regenerative Hyperplasia\\n\\nDrugs may be considered as risk factors for nodular regenerative hyperplasia and when possible it is suggested that the specific drug that has been associated is withdrawn.

       "    \"=== CHUNK 5 ===\\nContent: # Segment : Mitochondrial Hazards\\n\\nMitochondrial toxicity is exemplified by fialuridine, a nucleoside analogue that caused microvesicular fatty liver and ALF.142 Fialuridine leads to a depletion of mitochondrial DNA and patients treated for chronic hepatitis B developed weight loss, jaundice, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis.142 Microvesicular steatosis is also seen with amiodarone, valproate, tetracycline and various antiviral nucleoside analogues and is characterised by reduced numbers of mitochondria. Patients show hypoglycaemia, hyperammonemia and lactic acidosis but only mildly elevated levels of ALT.143 The majority of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used to treat HIV infection inhibit mitochondrial DNA polymerase c and consequently have a boxed warning regarding potential mitochondrial toxicity. Valproic acid inhibits the mitochondrial b-oxidation of fatty acids and the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thereby reducing oxidative phosphorylation and depleting intracellular ATP levels. This also leads to the generation of excessive ROS that can cause further cellular injury. Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) is the major scavenger of mitochondrial superoxide. A study in 185 patients from the Spanish DILI registry and population controls identified polymorphisms in the SOD2 as well as the glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) genes in patients who developed cholestatic or mixed type DILI in response to drugs believed to generate a reactive quinine-like or epoxide metabolite.144 Sod2 (+/-) mice have proven useful to elucidate mechanisms of mitochondrial toxicity such as troglitazone-induced liver injury.145 Reye’s syndrome describes an acute encephalopathy combined with liver injury that occurs in children treated with acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin), usually in the context of a viral infection such as influenza or varicella. Aspirin can uncouple mitochondria and inhibit mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, resulting in mainly microvesicular steatosis. Laboratory findings include hyperammonaemia, hypoprothrombinaemia and hypoglycaemia. Since the restriction of use of aspirin in children, the incidence of Reye’s syndrome has declined sharply.146 Troglitazone, nefazodone and benzbromarone, that were withdrawn from the market because of hepatotoxicity and are known mitochondrial toxicants, were also found to inhibit the bile salt export pump, BSEP (see below). Aleo et al. studied 72 compounds contained in the FDA’s Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base (LTKB) for their effects on mitochondrial respiration and inhibition of human BSEP transport activity.147 The LTKB contains a benchmark dataset of drugs whose potential to cause DILI is categorised into most-DILI-concern drugs (boxed warning or withdrawn from the market due to hepatotoxicity), less-DILI-concern drugs (DILI risk mentioned in the label) and no-DILI-concern drugs (no DILI indication in the label).148 This DILI classification has been refined by incorporating the causality assessment from clinical studies together with drug labelling information to improve its accuracy.149 Drugs with dual potency as mitochondrial and BSEP inhibitors were highly associated with more severe human DILI and appeared more sensitive to drug exposure (Cmax).147\\nSource: DILI_22_Mitochondr.md\\nFile ID: DILI_chunks_DILI_22_Mitochondr.md\\nSegment_ID: DILI_chunks\\nAttributes: {'Segment_ID': 'DILI_chunks', 'segment_id': 'DILI_chunks', 'filename': 'DILI_22_Mitochondr.md', 'content_length': 3250, 'pdf_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf', 'pdf_name': 'EASL_Clinical_Practice_Guidelines_Drug_induced_liver_injury.pdf', 'title': 'EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Mitochondrial Hazards', 'category': 'Liver Disease', 'author': 'EASL', 'page_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf#page=1', 'page_number': 1}\\nScore: 0.4000\\n=================\",\n",
       "    \"=== CHUNK 6 ===\\nContent: # Segment : Underlying Diseases and Comorbidity\\n\\nObservations that antimicrobials despite their relatively short exposure are among the most common cause of DILI has led to the hypothesis that ongoing systemic inflammatory response may provide a co-stimulatory ‘danger signal’ that promotes adaptive immune responses involved in the development of DILI. Similarly, an apparent excess risk of DILI with increasing age may also reflect higher comorbidity (as well as increased exposure to drugs) which may influence susceptibility to hepatotoxicity. However, there is limited evidence to support or refute the role of comorbidities in determining susceptibility to acute DILI. This is due to the fact that DILI is a rare event and hence is not identified in randomized controlled trials (RCT) designed to assess the efficacy of the drug, while longitudinal cohort studies involving large populations of people exposed to a particular drug with and without developing DILI are lacking. However, the effect of comorbidities has been evaluated in relation to drug-associated fatty liver disease (DAFLD). Evidence from well-designed studies indicates that drugs in this context work synergistically with other risk factors, contributing to pathogenesis and progression of liver disease. In a multicentre trial involving more than 5,000 women, tamoxifen therapy was associated with 2-fold risk of developing fatty liver over a 5-year period with an incidence of 0.4% per year in the treated group compared with 0.2% in the placebo group.99 This association was restricted to overweight and obese women and the increased risk manifested within the first 2 years of treatment. Other factors associated with the development of fatty liver included hypercholesterolemia and arterial hypertension. In a breast cancer registry,100 24 out of 1,105 (2.2%) had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; defined using a combination of imaging, liver enzyme elevation and biopsy); the odds of developing NASH increased 8.2-fold when patients were treated with tamoxifen and liver enzymes normalised in the majority after tamoxifen was stopped. In addition, the odds of NASH increased by 13% for every 1 kg/m2 increase in body mass index and decreased by 5% for every 1-year increase in age. Methotrexate-associated fatty liver disease and its severity has also been associated with alcohol excess, type 2 diabetes and obesity.101–103 A recent study demonstrated that obesity and type 2 diabetes were associated with patients being listed for transplantation for end-stage methotrexate-related liver disease.104\\nSource: DILI_16_Underlying.md\\nFile ID: DILI_chunks_DILI_16_Underlying.md\\nSegment_ID: DILI_chunks\\nAttributes: {'Segment_ID': 'DILI_chunks', 'segment_id': 'DILI_chunks', 'filename': 'DILI_16_Underlying.md', 'content_length': 2586, 'pdf_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf', 'pdf_name': 'EASL_Clinical_Practice_Guidelines_Drug_induced_liver_injury.pdf', 'title': 'EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Underlying Diseases and Comorbidity', 'category': 'Liver Disease', 'author': 'EASL', 'page_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/easl-pdf/DILI.pdf#page=1', 'page_number': 1}\\nScore: 0.4025\\n=================\",\n",
       "    \"=== CHUNK 7 ===\\nContent: # Segment : Acute Fatty Liver\\n\\nThis is a rare form of acute hepatotoxicity referred to as ‘Reye’s syndrome’ when seen in children treated with salicylate, although its occurrence has been reduced markedly by restricting the use of aspirin in those under the age of 16 years and the use of parenteral preparations of tetracycline. Microvesicular steatosis and absence of glycogen in the hepatocytes are characteristic histological features as the liver uses glycolysis to compensate for the lack of ATP produced by mitochondria. ALF related to microvesicular steatosis manifests with hypoglycaemia, lactic acidosis, hyperammonaemia and cerebral oedema. Dramatic rapid development of organ failure precedes the clinical syndrome with an acute rise in liver enzymes and jaundice that follow; hence, an index of suspicion is crucial in identifying the drug aetiology when approaching a patient with ‘anicteric hepatic encephalopathy’. This mechanism rarely causes DILI on its own; in a recent review of liver biopsies from 249 cases of DILI only 1 case of microvesicular steatosis was identified in a case of fatal injury secondary to erythromycin.168 Sodium valproate is 1 of the drugs currently used that has been linked to the development of acute fatty liver; idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity occurs 1 in 37,000 people taking the drug and the risk increases to 1 in 500 in children on combination of multiple drugs. A case-control study demonstrated an association between variation in the polymerase c gene, POLG, which codes for the mitochondrial DNA polymerase c, and valproateinduced hepatotoxicity.197 Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors are liable to cause hepatotoxicity by interfering with mitochondrial function.198 The incidence of severe hyperlactatemia with hepatic steatosis has been reported to be 0.85–3.9 per 1,000 person-years, with 33% mortality in severe cases.199 Stavudine, zalcitabine and didanosine have a higher affinity for mitochondrial DNA polymerase-c, leading to the depletion of mtDNA and hence, have a higher rate of hepatotoxicity than abacavir, zidovudine, lamivudine and tenofovir. Microvesicular steatosis and hepatocellular necrosis (resembling ‘Reye’s syndrome’) has also been reported in association with amiodarone.200\\n\\n### Recommendation for Acute Fatty Liver\\n\\nAcute drug-induced fatty liver can be recognised based on its distinct clinicopathological characteristics in people exposed to drugs that are known to interfere with mitochondrial function.

       "    \"=== CHUNK 8 ===\\nContent: # Segment : Specific Phenotypes: Drug-induced Autoimmune Hepatitis\\n\\nMany drugs have been associated with the syndrome drug-induced AIH that shares many features of idiopathic AIH. In cohorts of cases with the diagnosis of AIH, 2–9% were considered to be induced by drugs169,170 and conversely, drug-induced AIH accounts for 9% of all DILI.171 Most of these drugs have appeared in case reports or small case series and include nitrofurantoin, minocycline, diclofenac, statins and anti-TNFa agents (Table 4).172 Simplified Scoring System of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group that includes weighted scores for individual serological, genetic and liver histological features has become an accepted tool for the diagnosis of idiopathic AIH.173 However, in a recent large cohort study, only 65% of those meeting 1999 International AIH Group criteria also met simplified score based criteria.169 Likewise, when the differential diagnoses include drug-induced AIH, in addition to causality assessment, to assess the strength of association between drug exposure and the clinical manifestation, evaluation with genetic markers and liver biopsy are justified. Thorough characterisation of this particular subgroup of patients is important; histology might highlight features that favour one diagnosis over the other and genotyping would strengthen the diagnosis, assisting clinical decision making. Carriage of HLA alleles DRB1*03:01/*04:01 would favour the diagnosis of idiopathic AIH, while presence of DILI risk alleles would support the diagnosis of drug-induced AIH. Interestingly, one of the DILI risk alleles, HLA DRB1\\\\*15:01, occurs less frequently in association with idiopathic AIH than healthy controls, hence genetic testing aids decision making in this scenario (Table 4). The role of liver biopsy and genetic tests in the diagnosis and management of DILI have been discussed in detail under separate sections. In cases where even liver histological features cannot establish drug aetiology with certainty, it is reasonable to institute corticosteroid therapy in patients who do not show recovery despite drug cessation, with an intention to avoid progression of liver injury. However, once remission has been achieved, withdrawal of immunosuppression and close monitoring would resolve the diagnosis in the majority as drug-induced AIH do not relapse over a follow-up of 3–4 years,170,174 while patients with idiopathic AIH relapse in 63% of cases in 1 year and 75% in 5 years.175 Timing of withdrawal of immunosuppression and how one confirms the status of remission before attempting cessation of treatment varies between clinicians and clinical scenarios. It is best that such decisions are individualized by clinicians in discussion with the patient\\n\\n### Recommendations for Drug-induced AIH\\n\\nSuspected drug-induced AIH should be evaluated in detail including causality assessment, serology, genetic tests and liver biopsy whenever possible.
